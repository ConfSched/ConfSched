## Database Guide

### OpenConf

For the preplanning phase, OpenConf's database structure is used. You can find more information on OpenConf's database structure [here](http://www.openconf.com/documentation/tables.php).

### ConfSched

ConfSched is the database that this app utliizes. You don't necessarily need to name it ConfSched. However, if you change the name, you must update the settings in the configuration files.
